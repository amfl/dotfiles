These are my dotfiles :)

There is a `bootstrap.sh` script which sets everything up, but honestly when I'm setting up a new machine, I don't even run it - I just symlink what I need from the `conf` directory as I need it.

There is also a `notes.md` file, but this pretty disused - I keep my notes somewhere else these days.
