# Avoids fancy symbols where possible.

# Prompt and System

# Fiddle with the format to get the right things on the right lines.
# Note: $all contains the default modules, but it won't duplicate anything you 
#       explicitly define.
# Note: I don't use $all so I don't need to go through and turn off the modules
#       I don't want, which causes problems when new modules are created. Having
#       no $all works like a blocklist.
